She reached her first WTA final two years later at the 2016 Toray Pan Pacific Open, which took her into the top 50 in the world rankings. Her breakthrough year was 2018; in March she won Indian Wells, beating former world number ones Maria Sharapova and Karolína Plíšková in the first round and quarterfinals respectively, before defeating current No. 1 Simona Halep in the semifinals. In September, she won the 2018 US Open, defeating 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams in the final, and becoming the first Japanese player to win a Grand Slam singles tournament.
